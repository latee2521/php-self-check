PHP Self Check

Self Check
 	This application provides a method of checking out and renewing materials via a web interface using 3M's SIP2 standard
 	Thanks to John Wohlers for his sip2 class -this application would not have come about without it
	
	If you make additions or other customizations that improve or extend the self check's 
	functionality I would love to hear about them.
